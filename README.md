# CS-340-Assignment4---Part2

This program runs Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path to a node. The program is written in C/C++ and can be run on any compiler. When I ran the program, I ran it on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017. The program consists of three files. A main file called CS340_Assignment4_Part2.cpp and two header files, pch.h and pch.cpp are also included. To run the program, be sure to include all three files (include CS340_Assignment4_Part2.cpp, pch.h, pch.cpp). 

In addition to the three program files, I've also included additional files. There are two files containing the output of the algorithm. They are not required to run it, but just to show what output the program should have. I also included a picture of the input graph. The actual input graph is already in the main program file CS340_Assignment4_Part2.cpp. This picture file is not needed in running the program. It is there just to serve as a visualization of the input graph.

The program will find the shortest path from source node 0 to a node in the graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm. It will output the distance from the source to that node and as well as what path it used to reach it.
